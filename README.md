## 👋 hello

Our idea is to combine the power of computer vision model and LLMs. We use YOLO, CLIP and DINOv2 to extract high-level features from images. Then we use natural language as an interface for the user. We pass the prompt, along with the extracted features, to LLM, allowing for advanced image dataset queries.

## 🎯 goals

Keep in mind that the project is still under 🚧 construction. We will successively publish updates and new features. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skalskip92) to stay up to date.
